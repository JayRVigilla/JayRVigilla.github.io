I"Ú<p>Hi! Iâ€™m Jay and Iâ€™m a Web Dev. I grew up and live in the San Francisco Bay Area. Iâ€™ve been a Food &amp; Hospitality Professional for years. I started coding to problem solve at work and build things. In March 2020 I started a Full-Stack coding boot camp and started to take steps for a career change. Iâ€™ll be doing tutorials, blogging things Iâ€™m building, and weâ€™ll see what else.</p>
