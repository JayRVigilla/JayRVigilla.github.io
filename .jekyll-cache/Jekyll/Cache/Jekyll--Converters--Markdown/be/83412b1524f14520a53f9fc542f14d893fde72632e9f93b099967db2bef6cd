<p>One of my favorite dishes to make in restaurants was porridge. To be more concise: I liked making risotto in restaurants. Risotto is an instance of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Porridge</code>. So is polenta, arroz caldo, and congee. And I like cooking steal head oats, which is also an iteration of â€œporridge.â€ Calling something an instance, or â€œinstantiation,â€ is how we say that there is a big definition of something, â€œporridge,â€ and there are other foods that fall under the big umbrella definition. Having a larger definition of something, a blueprint, is one of the reasons for Object-Oriented Programming. It also helps to define things in our world.</p>
