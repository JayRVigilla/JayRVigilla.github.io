<p>Years ago, I fell in love with a career. Every day I went to work excited to do and learn more about the industry. With so many different sources of information and a wide variety of styles to dive deep into it was a learnerâ€™s paradise. Iâ€™d leave work and spend my nights at home experimenting with a small idea until the late hours of the night. Then I found out what it was that was exciting about this industry. I thrived on solving problems. I loved finding new ways to accomplish anything in the Restaurant Industry, but it turned out I loved solving problems anywhere!</p>
