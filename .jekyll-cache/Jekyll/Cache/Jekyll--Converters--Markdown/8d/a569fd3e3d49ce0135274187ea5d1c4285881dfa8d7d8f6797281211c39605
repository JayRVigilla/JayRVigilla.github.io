I"><p>Hi! I’m Jay, a recent boot camp grad and half-his-life-Food-&amp;-Hospitality-Professional. I’m looking for work. Yes, a J-O-B. That process is in the works, though <em>everyone</em> is looking for work right now thanks to the <strong>COVID</strong> craziness we’ve all been swept into. While I’ve got some ideas kicking around, I’ll use this opportunity to keep limber and code.</p>

<p>This is where I should declare:
I’m going to start #100daysofcode on Monday, 07/13/2020.</p>

<p>I’ll be following the rules here at <a href="https://www.100daysofcode.com/">100daysofcode.com</a>. They’re super simple:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.</li>
  <li>Tweet your progress every day with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.</li>
</ol>

<p>And there’s a little more, but that’s the only real time commitment. I’ll do a little more exposition here on what I’ve done.</p>

<h2 id="my-first-project"><strong>My first project:</strong></h2>
<hr />
<p>A Node.js script that will help write cover letters. I said I was looking for work, I might as well spread the love. 🤷🏽‍♂️</p>

<p>I want it to be able to take a template cover letter and fill in fields for Company Name and Job Title. Maybe the Hiring/Team Manager if that’s known.</p>

<p>There will be another file with all of a user’s war story blurbs. That’s what <em>I</em> think of them as. I’m pretty confident that’s not an industry term. You know, those statements that say: “I have a desirable attribute from this role, a quick anecdote and data to qualify all that.” A user should be able to choose from this file which stories to import into the final cover letter.</p>

<p>Then there will be an optional third file that will have two things:</p>
<ol>
  <li>“Here’s why I’m reaching out and a good fit,” statement to open up the cover letter.</li>
  <li>“Here’s a little something to try to make me memorable,” for the end of the letter.</li>
</ol>

<p>The script should output your Mad Libbed cover letter so you can send it along.</p>

<p>Wish me luck!</p>
