I"%<p>Near the end of coding boot camp we were giving lightning talks in class. They’re five to seven minute presentations about a technology/library/what-have-you. Everyone had prepared to answer questions. One of my classmates gave a great talk and at the end he <em>didn’t</em> ask for questions. Instead he said: “I’d like to leave the floor open for questions, but you’re Engineers so just read the docs first.” We all laughed and cheered the chutzpah to say such a thing… then today happened and I am laughing at myselfhumbled.</p>
