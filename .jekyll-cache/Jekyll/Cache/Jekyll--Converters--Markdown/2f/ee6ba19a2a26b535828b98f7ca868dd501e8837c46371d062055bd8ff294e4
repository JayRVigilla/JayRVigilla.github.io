I"ç<p>Hi! I‚Äôm Jay, a recent boot camp grad and half-his-life-Food-&amp;-Hospitality-Professional. I‚Äôm looking for work. Yes, a J-O-B. That process is in the works, though <em>everyone</em> is looking for work right now thanks to the <strong>COVID</strong> craziness we‚Äôve all been swept into. While I‚Äôve got some ideas kicking around, I‚Äôll use this opportunity to keep limber and code.</p>
