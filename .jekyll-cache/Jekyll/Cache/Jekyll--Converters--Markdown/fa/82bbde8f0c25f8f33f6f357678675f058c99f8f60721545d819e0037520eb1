<p>What scared me about learning to code was thinking there was a lot of math involved. I muddled through Calc 2 in college, but I canâ€™t say that any of it stuck. Calculus forwards is hard enough, now weâ€™re doing it backward? This fear came about because the operators and symbols used are also in math equations. When really, coding is more like writing logical instructions to computers with words. Coding is in a language after all.</p>
