I"‘<p>Hi! Iâ€™m Jay, a recent boot camp grad and half-his-life-Food-&amp;-Hospitality-Professional. Iâ€™m looking for work. Yes, a J-O-B. That process is in the works, though <em>everyone</em> is looking for work right now thanks to the <strong>__COVID__</strong> craziness weâ€™ve all been swept into. While Iâ€™ve got some ideas kicking around, Iâ€™ll use this opportunity to keep limber and code.</p>
