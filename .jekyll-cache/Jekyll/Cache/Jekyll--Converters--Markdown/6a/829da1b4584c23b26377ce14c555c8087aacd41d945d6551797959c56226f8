I"š<p>Well, off to a decent start. I spent about 50 minutes the first night and 30 the next. I started by setting up the GitHub repo, starting documentation, and starting the readme file. Letâ€™s be honest, I know these will grow so Iâ€™d better get them started now.</p>

<p>Coding was easy enough for the initial function getFile(). Iâ€™m using fs to read files in an adjacent folder. The idea would be that the user puts their cover letter template, file of blurbs, and a business-specific-details file into the templates folder. So as far as calling the function to return the requested file: done.</p>

<p>The next function Iâ€™m working on uses the getFile()</p>
