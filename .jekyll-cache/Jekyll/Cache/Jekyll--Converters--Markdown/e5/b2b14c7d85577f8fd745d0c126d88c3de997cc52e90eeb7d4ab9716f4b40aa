I"Ò<p>Near the end of coding boot camp we were giving lightning talks in class. Theyâ€™re five to seven minute presentations about a technology/library/what-have-you. Everyone had prepared to answer questions. One of my classmates gave a great talk and at the end he <em>didnâ€™t</em> ask for questions. Instead he said: â€œIâ€™d like to leave the floor open for questions, but youâ€™re Engineers so just read the docs first.â€ We all laughed and cheered the ball</p>
