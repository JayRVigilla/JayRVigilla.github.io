I"º<p>In my teenage years I romanticized diners. Tonight I ended up talking about those greasy spoons with my partner. Now here in lies my problem: I grew up in Sam Jose, CA while she grew up in New Jersey. This isnâ€™t some East Coast vs West Coast smack-down, I knew I was just outclassed in this conversation. Jersey diners vs San Jose diners? Fuggedaboudit. She took pity on me and we started defining a diner to even the playing field.</p>
