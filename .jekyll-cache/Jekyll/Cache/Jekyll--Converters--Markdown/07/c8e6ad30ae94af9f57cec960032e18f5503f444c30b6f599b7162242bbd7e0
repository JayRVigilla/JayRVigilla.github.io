I"µ<p>Near the end of coding boot camp we were giving lightning talks in class. Theyâ€™re five to seven minute) tech talks about a technology/library/what-have-you. Everyone had prepared to answer any questions we could anticipate. One of my classmates gave a great talk. At the end he didnâ€™t ask for questions. Instead he said: â€œIâ€™d like to leave the floor open for questions, but youâ€™re Engineers so just read the docs first.</p>
