<p>What scared me learning to code was thinking there was a lot of math. I muddled through Calc 2 in college. None of it stuck. This fear came about because the only recognizable characters I saw were things wrapped in braces, + and =. There were even &lt;, &gt;, and arrows! Finding mistakes in math always meant doing more work to fix it, which did not appeal to college me. Instead, coding is like learning to speak a new language. There are multiple translations to do before you make sense.</p>
