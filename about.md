Hi! I'm Jay and I'm a Web Dev. I grew up and live in the San Francisco Bay Area. I've been a Food & Hospitality Professional for years. I started coding to problem solve at work and build things. In March 2020 I started a Full-Stack coding boot camp and started to take steps for a career change. I'll be doing tutorials, blogging things I'm building, and we'll see what else.

### More Information

I'm a father of two, doggy daddy to our rescue named Copper, happily coupled fo' life, and a recovering comicbook geek (went comicbook sober in my early 30s).
