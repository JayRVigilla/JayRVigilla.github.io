&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer in the San Francisco Bay Area. My career in tech started after graduating from Rithm School in San Francisco. Rithm is a Full Stack Coding boot camp that takes students from vanilla JavaScript to company internships.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my spare time I enjoy cooking and baking, gardening, running with my dog, strength training, and any excuse to be in the sun with my family. I also enjoy escape rooms, trivia, and board games.
