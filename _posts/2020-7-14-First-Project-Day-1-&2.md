title: CoverLetter Project Day 1 & 2
---

Well, off to a decent start. I spent about 50 minutes on the first night and 30 the next. I started by setting up the GitHub repo, starting documentation, and starting the readme file. Let's be honest, I know these will grow so I'd better get them started now.

Coding was easy enough for the initial function getFile(). I'm using fs to read files in an adjacent folder. The idea would be that the user puts their cover letter template, file of blurbs, and a business-specific-details file into the templates folder. So as far as calling the function to return the requested file: done.

The next function I'm working on uses getFile() to assign the three user files to variables. Unfortunately, they're coming back undefined. Something to build on tomorrow!

I'm currently working on a technical take-home project for a job interview so my "free-time" as a parent is focused on the take-home project.
