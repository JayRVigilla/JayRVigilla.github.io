title: Hello, World.

Hi! I'm Jay, a recent boot camp grad and half-his-life-Food-&-Hospitality-Professional. I'm looking for work. Yes, a J-O-B. That process is in the works, though _everyone_ is looking for work right now thanks to the **__COVID__** craziness we've all been swept into. While I've got some ideas kicking around, I'll use this opportunity to keep limber and code.

So here we go...

__My first project:__
---------------------
---------------------
A Node.js script that will help write cover letters. I said I was looking for work, I might as well spread the love. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I want it to be able to take a template cover letter and fill in fields for Company Name and Job Title. Maybe the Hiring/Team Manager if that's known.

There will be another file with all of a user's war story blurbs. That's what _I_ think of them as. I'm pretty confident that's not an industry term. You know, those statements that say: "I have a desirable attribute from this role, a quick anecdote and data to qualify all that." A user should be able to choose from this file which stories to import into the final cover letter.

Then there will be an optional third file that will have two things:
 1. "Here's why I'm reaching out and a good fit," statement to open up the cover letter.
 2. "Here's a little something to try to make me memorable," for the end of the letter.

The script should output your Mad Libbed cover letter so you can send it along.

Wish me luck!
